## Database Seeding & Production Synchronization

### Admin Credentials
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: admin123

### Automatic Database Seeding
The application now includes **automatic seeding on startup**:

**How it works:**
1. On every app start, checks if database is empty (<=2 users, 0 articles, 0 podcasts, or 0 forum discussions)
2. If empty, automatically seeds with complete sample data including forum discussions and replies
3. If already populated, skips seeding and logs current counts
4. **This ensures production gets seeded automatically when published!**

**Server log examples:**
```
[express] Checking database status...
[express] ✓ Database already populated (13 users, 11 articles, 10 podcasts, 9 discussions)
```

### Current Database Status
**Development Database:** ✅ Fully synchronized
- 13 users (10 community members + 3 admins)
- 11 news articles across 4 categories
- 10 podcast episodes (Episodes 3-12)
- 12 educational resources
- 3 forum categories
- **9 forum discussions with 21 replies** (NEW!)

**Production Database:** Will auto-seed on first deployment

### Sample Data Included
- **10 Community Contributors**: Sarah Mitchell (Deloitte), James Rodriguez (KPMG), Emily Chen (PwC), and 7 more with complete profiles
- **11 News Articles**: Automation, Fraud Detection, Regulatory, Generative AI categories
- **10 Podcast Episodes**: Full metadata, audio URLs, sorted by date
- **12 Educational Resources**: Guides, videos, templates, tools with ratings
- **3 Forum Categories**: AI Implementation, Regulatory Compliance, Learning & Development
- **9 Forum Discussions**: Real AI/accounting topics with threaded conversations

  - "Machine Learning model accuracy for audit sampling?" (12 replies)
  - "RPA vs. AI for AP automation?" (6 replies)

### Manual Rebuild Option
The admin panel still includes a **"Rebuild Database"** button (orange border) for manual control:
- Clears all seed data (preserves admin accounts)
- Re-inserts fresh sample data
- Useful for resetting data during development

### Production Deployment (Automatic)
1. **Publish to Replit** → Schema transfers, data does not
2. **App starts in production** → Detects empty database (checks forum discussions too!)
3. **Auto-seeding triggers** → Populates all sample data including 9 forum discussions with 21 replies
4. **Production ready!** → Same data as development

**No manual steps required!** Both environments automatically maintain identical seed data including community forums.
