Seeing the writing on the wall with AI automation, I want to pivot into an AI-focused role.\n\nWhat skills should I prioritize learning? Python? Statistics? Machine learning?\n\nAlso, is it realistic to make this transition, or should I just focus on becoming an expert in using AI tools rather than building them?",
